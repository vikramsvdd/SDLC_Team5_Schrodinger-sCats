# 1. Introduction
This project is implemented using the c programming language.The main goal is to implement the various operations on a discrete time signal using the concepts of signals and systems.

# 2. Research
In signal processing, a signal is a function that conveys information about a phenomenon In electronics and telecommunications, it refers to any time varying voltage, current, or electromagnetic wave that carries information.Even in nature, signals can be actions done by an organism to alert other organisms.

With regards to Modern day, Signal processing plays a major part in innovation and creativity.Hence it is important to understand and learn some of the basic operations that can be performed on a signal. A discrete time signal is one of the simplest form of a signal on which multiple operations can be performed .

Concepts like **convolution** **Fourier Transforms** are key to any signal processing application.Keeping in mind the importance of the mentioned few concepts,our project plans on implementing a few other concepts with the help of a simple user friendly interface that helps in performing these operations on a discrete time signal.

# 3.Defining The System

Our System mainly is a user friendly system that takes in the choice of a user. This choice determines what operation is to be performed.Once the valid choice is obtained from the user,the system then prompts the user to give in the input discrete time signal. Then as per the choice of the user,a particular task is performed and the obtained resultant signal is displayed. The user gets another chance to give a choice and if he chooses to quit the program ends.
